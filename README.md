# SoundCloudPlayer
A weekend project to create a custom application to play tracks off a SoundCloud playlist

Steps to set up application:

execute 
$ npm install

execute 
$ bower install


Before running the application register it at http://soundcloud.com/you/apps 
and obtain a client ID. Set that client ID to the soundCloudClientId 
variable in the widget directive constructor.
